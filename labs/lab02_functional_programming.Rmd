## Functional Programming

In this lab, we will practice using functional programming to simplify the task
of reading in data from different files and cleaning it. We will create a
function that encapsulates the steps that are currently in the script to read in
and clean the data, so it's ready for our analysis (filtering to a certain
property and type of animal and counting the number of call per month). 

We'll add this, in the script, to the function that we developed in the lecture
right before this lab, and we'll look at how using functions can help us
encapsulate tasks within the code in a way that lets us reuse the code without
copying and pasting it. In a later lab, we'll add to these ideas by exploring
how using the `map` function in the `purrr` package can help simplify the
process.

## Setting up for this lab

To start this lab, make sure that you have a copy of the script we ended up with
at the end of the last lab. If you created a different version, you're welcome
to use that instead, but keep in mind that you may need to adjust the example
code given in this lab to accommodate differences in your version (for example,
different names you selected for objects or columns).

As a reminder, here's the code we ended up with at the end of the last lab: 

```{r eval = F}
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Read in data and clean column names
man_animal_resp <- read_csv("../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)

# Filter to data on reptiles and amphibians in Central Park
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  filter(property == "Central Park") %>%  
  filter(animal_class == "Terrestrial Reptile or Amphibian")

# Filter to years with data covering the full year (2018 and 2021 do not)
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call), 
         call_year = year(datetime_call)) %>% 
  filter(call_year %in% c(2019, 2020))

# Count number of response calls per month
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(call_month = month(datetime_call, 
                            label = TRUE, 
                            abbr = FALSE))
  
monthly_man_animal_response <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  count(.wt = call_month)
monthly_man_animal_response
```

In the lecture before this class, we covered how to create a function that
counts the number of calls per month (we'll work on improving this function in a
later lab). You'll also find it useful to have the code that defines this
function handy. It is:

```{r}
# To run this function, you will need to have the following packages installed:
# dplyr, tibble
count_monthly_calls <- function(call_data) {
  monthly_calls <- call_data %>% 
    dplyr::count(.wt = call_month) %>% 
    dplyr::rename(month = .wt)
  
  all_months <- tibble::tibble(month = c("January", "February", "March", "April", 
                                         "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", 
                                         "October", "November", "December"), 
                               order = 1:12)
  
  monthly_calls <- dplyr::full_join(monthly_calls, all_months, by = "month") %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(order) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-order)
  
  return(monthly_calls)
}
```

In the lecture, we also looked at how we could edit the script to use this
function. Here's the version of the script that includes the function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

## Define functions ######################################################################

# To run this function, you will need to have the following packages installed:
# dplyr, tibble
count_monthly_calls <- function(call_data) {
  monthly_calls <- call_data %>% 
    dplyr::count(.wt = call_month) %>% 
    dplyr::rename(month = .wt)
  
  all_months <- tibble::tibble(month = c("January", "February", "March", "April", 
                                         "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", 
                                         "October", "November", "December"), 
                               order = 1:12)
  
  monthly_calls <- dplyr::full_join(monthly_calls, all_months, by = "month") %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>% 
    dplyr::arrange(order) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-order)
  
  return(monthly_calls)
}

## Analysis #####################################################################

# Read in data and clean column names
man_animal_resp <- read_csv("../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)

# Filter to data on reptiles and amphibians in Central Park
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  filter(property == "Central Park") %>%  
  filter(animal_class == "Terrestrial Reptile or Amphibian")

# Filter to years with data covering the full year (2018 and 2021 do not)
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call), 
         call_year = year(datetime_call)) %>% 
  filter(call_year %in% c(2019, 2020))

# Count number of response calls per month
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(call_month = month(datetime_call, 
                            label = TRUE, 
                            abbr = FALSE)) 
monthly_man_animal_response <- count_monthly_calls(man_animal_resp) 
monthly_man_animal_response
```

Notice how this script continues to use blocking to reinforce separate sections
of the code, now both in terms of tasks that are being done and also in terms of
separating the function definitions from the analysis script. Also, you may have
noticed that we needed to rearrange some of the code so that we could add in the
column `call_month` before we run the new function, since the function relies on
having that column in the data.

## Writing a function

Now it's your turn to try writing a function. Let's write a function the
encapsulates all the steps of reading in and cleaning the data. We'll then edit
the script to incorporate this function.

The first step is to go through the code script and identify all the steps that
you are doing that are related to reading in and cleaning the data.

Those steps are: 

- Read data from the CSV files
- Clean the column names (this includes a first step of general cleaning and then 
some more specialized cleaning to treat a case that wasn't handled in the general 
step)
- Convert the column with the dates to a date-time class, so you can work with it
in later code as a date-time object

There are some other steps you might want to consider as well, depending on how
you plan to look at the data once you read it in. Some other steps you could
consider adding to this function are:

- Removing columns that you aren't planning to use in your analysis (There are a
lot of columns in this dataset, and it can make it easier to work on your target
problem if you remove those from your working dataframe in R. Remember that this
won't delete the columns from the data saved in the CSV, so that data will
always be available if you need to go back and add them.)
- Add columns for the month and year (These are new columns that you use in some
of your analysis, so it may make sense to create these as you read in the data.
These steps are easy to do in the code script, too, once you've read in the
data, but if you know you'll want them in your data, you could extract that step
to the reading / cleaning process.)
- Filter to full years of call data (in this case, 2019 and 2020)

We'll first write a function that encapsulates the steps we know we want to put
in the function, then we'll look at how we could add these additional pieces.
Let's start by looking at the script to see which parts we want to pull out
(I've added comments on those in the script):

```{r eval = F}
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Read in data and clean column names
man_animal_resp <- read_csv("../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv") %>% # Put in function
  clean_names() %>%                                                      # Put in function
  rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)                  # Put in function

# Filter to data on reptiles and amphibians in Central Park
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  filter(property == "Central Park") %>%  
  filter(animal_class == "Terrestrial Reptile or Amphibian")

# Filter to years with data covering the full year (2018 and 2021 do not)
man_animal_resp <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call),                         # Put in function
         call_year = year(datetime_call)) %>%                            # Maybe put in function
  filter(call_year %in% c(2019, 2020))                                   # Maybe put in function

# Count number of response calls per month
monthly_man_animal_response <- man_animal_resp %>% 
  mutate(call_month = month(datetime_call,                               # Maybe put in function
                            label = TRUE, 
                            abbr = FALSE)) %>% 
  count(.wt = call_month)
monthly_man_animal_response
```

The following code chunk defines a function that encapsulates the parts we know
we want to go in the function. Take a look at how this compares to the code in the 
script above. Hopefully you notice that a lot of the code is very similar to the code 
in the script. The key difference is that we're defining a parameter with the filename 
(`file`) and then using that as an input to the next steps, rather than a character string
with a single filename as we did in the script. Also, the function is using `return` to 
specify what we'd like to get out of the function once it's run. 

```{r}
read_and_clean_call_data <- function(file){
  
  # Read in data and clean column names
  call_data <- read_csv(file = file) %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)
  
  # Convert date-time column to appropriate data type
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call))
  
  return(call_data)
}
```

Once you have run this code---which defines the function in your R session---you
can try it out:

```{r}
manhattan_calls <- read_and_clean_call_data(file = "../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv")

manhattan_calls
```

Some notes on this process: 

- You get to pick the name for the function, as well as the name for each 
parameter in the function. For naming parameters, it can be helpful if you use
similar names to those used in more general functions. For example, the heart of
this new function is to read in data from a CSV. We'll need a parameter that
lists the name of the file that you want to read in. It's helpful to use the
same parameter name as the one used by the general function `read_csv`, which is
`file`.
- You can include code comments within the function

Now let's add some more steps (adding columns for the month and year of the
call, and removing all the columns we're not interested in for our research
question):

```{r}
read_and_clean_call_data <- function(file){
  
  # Read in data and clean column names
  call_data <- read_csv(file = file) %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)
  
  # Limit to columns we'll need for our research question
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    select(datetime_call, property, location, species_description, 
           animal_class, final_ranger_action)
  
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    # Convert date-time column to appropriate data type
    mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call)) %>%
    # Add columns for the year and month of the call
    mutate(call_year = year(datetime_call),
           call_month = month(datetime_call,
                              label = TRUE, 
                              abbr = FALSE)) 
  
  return(call_data)
}
```

Now, let's add an optional part of the function, an optional filter to the years
with data year-round. To do that, we'll add a new parameter called 
`remove_partial_years`. When a user wants to filter to only the years with 
year-round data, they can now specify `remove_partial_years = TRUE` when 
they call the function. We'll set the parameter equal to `FALSE` when we add
it within the `function` call, so if the user doesn't include it when they 
call the function, this parameter will default to `FALSE`. 

```{r}
read_and_clean_call_data <- function(file, remove_partial_years = FALSE){
  
  # Read in data and clean column names
  call_data <- read_csv(file = file) %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)
  
  # Limit to columns we'll need for our research question
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    select(datetime_call, property, location, species_description, 
           animal_class, final_ranger_action)
  
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    # Convert date-time column to appropriate data type
    mutate(datetime_call = mdy_hms(datetime_call)) %>%
    # Add columns for the year and month of the call
    mutate(call_year = year(datetime_call),
           call_month = month(datetime_call,
                              label = TRUE, 
                              abbr = FALSE)) 
  
  if(remove_partial_years == TRUE) {
    call_data <- call_data %>% 
      filter(call_year %in% c(2019, 2020))
  }
  
  return(call_data)
}
```

You can see that we're using an `if` statement now. When R gets to the `if` 
statement, it will check to see if `remove_partial_years` is set to `TRUE`. 
If so, it will run all the code in the curly braces (`{` and `}`) right 
after the `if` statement. If not, it will skip that code.

Again, once you've run this code to update your function definition in your R
session, you can try the function on an example file:

```{r}
manhattan_calls <- read_and_clean_call_data(file = "../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv")

manhattan_calls

manhattan_full_years <- read_and_clean_call_data(file = "../data/Manhattan_animal_response.csv",
                                                 remove_partial_years = TRUE)
manhattan_full_years
```

Next, it's helpful if we add some code that clarifies which package each
function in the code comes from. This way, the function can run as long as the
user has installed that package, whether or not the the user has remembered to
load the package in their R session. You can all add comments to let the user
know which packages they'll need to have installed to run the function.

```{r} 
# To run this function, you will need to have the following functions installed:
# readr, janitor, dplyr, lubridate
read_and_clean_call_data <- function(file, remove_partial_years = FALSE){
  
  # Read in data and clean column names
  call_data <- readr::read_csv(file = file) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    dplyr::rename(datetime_call = date_and_time_of_initial_call)
  
  # Limit to columns we'll need for our research question
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    dplyr::select(datetime_call, property, location, species_description, 
                  animal_class, final_ranger_action)
  
  call_data <- call_data %>% 
    # Convert date-time column to appropriate data type
    dplyr::mutate(datetime_call = lubridate::mdy_hms(datetime_call)) %>%
    # Add columns for the year and month of the call
    dplyr::mutate(call_year = lubridate::year(datetime_call),
                  call_month = lubridate::month(datetime_call,
                                                label = TRUE, 
                                                abbr = FALSE)) 
  
  if(remove_partial_years == TRUE) {
    call_data <- call_data %>% 
      dplyr::filter(call_year %in% c(2019, 2020))
  }
  
  return(call_data)
}
```

Now you can edit your script to use this function: 

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
